Student ID: 313551073

Name: È°èÁê¶ÊÅ©

## Introduction

Homework 2 focuses on digit recognition in photographs, where a model learns to detect and classify numerical digits in real-world conditions. The task involves data preprocessing, designing a Fast R-CNN-based model, and implementing training, validation, and evaluation procedures. The dataset is provided by the TAs, and further details are provided below.

## Requirements

The pretrained model used in this homework is from pytorch, just make sure to have a python environment with a proper pytorch version.

## Getting started

### Training

- To train and validate the model, execute the command `python main.py`, please checkout the dataset path and the checkpoint path before executing.
- The testing process will be automatically executed if line 190 and 191 in the main function aren't commented.
- The parameter `resume` in the main function can only be used for resuming the training process.

### Inference

- To test the model, run `python main.py` with line 187 and 188 in main function commented.
